## Problem Description
[Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1381/C)

Given two arrays of length n, where the value belongs to `[1, n + 1]`, there will be `x` exact matching (value and index), and `y` matching values.

The problem is given one of the two arrays, `x` and `y`, try to figure out the other array.

### Sample Input
```
7
5 2 4
3 1 1 2 5
5 3 4
1 1 2 1 2
4 0 4
5 5 3 3
4 1 4
2 3 2 3
6 1 2
3 2 1 1 1 1
6 2 4
3 3 2 1 1 1
6 2 6
1 1 3 2 1 1
```

### Sample Output
```
YES
3 1 6 1 2
YES
3 1 1 1 2
YES
3 3 5 5
NO
YES
4 4 4 4 3 1
YES
3 1 3 1 7 7
YES
2 3 1 1 1 1
```

## Solution
[Solution Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/1381/submission/88104504)

### Outline
1. Find `x` exact match.
2. Find `y-x` value but not index match.
3. Fill other positions with the missing elements.

### Step 1

It's easy to figure out we need to use the most frequent element as much as possible.

### Step 2

There are several good and bad ideas.

1. Using the most frequent elements. Pop out two most frequent elements and assign to each other. This is **incorrect**! One counterexample is `1 2 3`.
2. Sort the elements and match with the reverse of the sorted array. This is **incorrect**! One counter example is `1 1 2 2 2 3 3`.
3. Using the most frequent elements, and for >2 number of same top frequenet of elements, we need to use them at the same time, by shifting them by 1.
4. Sort the elements and shift the elements by the max number of occurance.
5. Sort the elements and shift the elements by the half of the array length.


### Looking back

The victory of acceptance makes the hard work to solve the problem totally worth it!
