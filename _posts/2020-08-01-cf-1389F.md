## Problem Description
[Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1389/F)

Given 2 * 1e5 ranges with two colors, find maximum ranges that ranges with different color may not overlap.

## Solution

Solution from the [tutorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/80809)

### Bipartite Match on a special graph

If we consider the relationship of two ranges with different color overlap as an edge and each range as a vertex, the problem is to calculate the maxmium independent set of a special bipartite graph. And 
```
|independent_set| = n - |match|
```

Here is a greed algorithm to find the max match of this graph.

#### For each range R sorted by `right`, if there are ranges connecting to it, match R with the range with minimal `right`.

To get better implementation, we can sort the range ends as events, and use two sets to maintain the range can be used in the match. Details can be found in [code](https://codeforces.com/contest/1389/submission/88696078).

### Segment Tree + DP


```
DP states:
dp[i][t] := for type `t`, the max number of chosen ranges with right end == i.

State transformation:
For each range R,
1. dp[R.right][R.t] = max(dp[1..R.left - 1][1 - R.t]) + 1
2. dp[1..R.left - 1][1 - R.t] += 1
```
