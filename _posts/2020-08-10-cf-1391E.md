## Problem Description
[Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1391/E)

Given a undirected connected graph, with `n` vertices and `m` edges, find either
1. A path that at least (n+1) / 2 long.
2. A pairing with at least (n+1)/2, where the induced subgraph of any pair of pairs is with at most 2 edges.

## Solution

Solution from the [tutorial](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/81265)

### DFS Tree

The DFS tree of an undirected graph, are with two kind of edges, the `Tree Edge` and `Backward Edge`.
If there is a path between `u` and `v`, `u` and `v` are  `ancestor-descendants`.

(The DFS tree of a directed graph, are with four kind of edges, the `Tree Edge`, `Forward Edge`, `Backward Edge` and `Cross Edge`.)

### Constructive Method

So, if there is a vertex is with depth >= (n+1)/2, we can get a path.
Otherwise, we can pair the vertices with the same depth. The number of vertices we can use is at least `n - max depth` > `n - (n+1)/2` >= `(n+1)/2`.
For two pairs`<a, b>, <c, d>`, if `a` is connected with `c` and `d`, since `<a, c, d>` are `ancestor-descendants`, `c` and `d` cannot be on the same level. Therefore, the pairing is valid.
